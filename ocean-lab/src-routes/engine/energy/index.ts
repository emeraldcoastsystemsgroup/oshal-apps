 * 1 | maintainer@emeraldcoastsystemsgroup.com   | Initial creation — barrel for the harvest-agnostic energy
 *                     |                             | budget extracted from the marine slice, so a second harvest
 *                     |                             | domain reuses the engine through one seam (HarvestSampler)
 *                     |                             | instead of forking its arithmetic.

 * Domain-free by construction — the only environmental coupling is {@link HarvestSampler}.
